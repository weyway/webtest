# Gathering Medals

## Yo-kai Medals

Equip the [Yo-kai Watch](https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Yo-kai_Watch) and take part in FATEs in the areas listed below:
- **A Realm Reborn**
	- La Noscea
	- The Black Shroud
	- Thanalan
- **Heavensward**
	- All regions
- **Stormblood**
	- All regions

> [!faq]- What are FATEs?
> FATEs are open-world events that occur spontaneously throughout Eorzea where you and other adventurers join together to fight monsters or assist people in distress. FATEs in progress appear as purple icons on the map, so you can easily locate one and jump in at any time!

> [!tip] If you are above the level of a FATE, do not forget to sync down your level to be able to participate!
## Legendary Yo-kai Medals

Legendary Yo-kai Medals are obtainable by participating in certain FATEs while accompanied by the Yo-kai minion that corresponds to the desired weapon.
With a lot of dedication (and luck), you can gather enough medals to get any Yo-kai weapon you want!

There are specific destinations where you should go to gather Legendary Medals, and the location is different depending on the weapon. Be sure to check the Yo-kai Medallium for details on where to go to search for medals.
